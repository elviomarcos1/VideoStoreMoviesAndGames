🎬 Movie and Game Rental
👋 Welcome!

We are pleased to present the project "Movie and Game Rental", developed as part of our educational journey to apply and strengthen our knowledge of programming and database management using Java and SQLite.

🧩 Challenge
The proposed challenge for this project was to create a complete rental management system for a movie and game rental store.
📚 A project that simulated real-world needs and helped reinforce key concepts in object-oriented programming, database integration, and user interface design.

🖥️ The System
With the goal of replacing the traditional paper-based control used by many rental stores, this system allows administrators to manage their catalog and transactions digitally, through an intuitive and organized interface.

To achieve this, the following features were implemented:

📥 Item Registration: Add and update information about available movies and games

🔁 Rental Management: Record and track item loans and returns

🔎 Data Search: Perform searches and queries on items and transaction history

📊 Reports: Generate detailed reports on inventory status and rental activities

This system was designed to simplify administrative routines and bring greater efficiency to the management of physical media rentals.
